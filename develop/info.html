                    <h2>Welcome to the Character Creator!</h2>
                    <h3>Are you interested in Dungeoning some Dragons?</h3>
                    <p>For those that are new to this game, and even for experienced players who want somewhere to log their information, this application here is to help you get started on building a character. But before we go into how the form works, here is what you need to know for the basics of Dungeons and Dragons. We're going to give you the basic roles, settings, and how to set up your character through the playable races, classes, and skill proficiencies.</p>

                    <h3>Getting started</h3>
                    <p>As a basic description, Dungeons and Dragons utilizes a world of make believe usually taking place in a medieval and fantastical setting where magic, unusual creatures, and heroes exist. It is a roleplaying game where a group of people, large or small, gather and create characters to take part in this world that has been created. The adventure that the group goes on is usually called a campaign and can last however long until the story they're playing through is over. In playing these campaigns, two roles exist: <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> and <strong>Players</strong>. The <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> tends to be a single person that has set up the campaign, the world the players are in (including cities, inhabitants, and monsters), and narrates the story as the players go along. The <strong>Players</strong> interact with the world that is set in front of them, free to do just about anything with their characters. It is the role of the <strong>Players</strong> that this application focuses on completely, though the <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> can also utilize it in creating NPC's (non-playable characters).</p>

                    <h3>Character Creation</h3>                        
                    <p>Coming up with your own character from scratch can be a bit daunting at first, but there is no pressure towards coming up with something grand or fantastical. The best way to create a character is to go with what you know and like, as many first time players tend to create characters that are more like themselves in a fantasy world. The best place to start is with a name! It could be anything as fantastical Filavandrel or Cirilla to something as simple as Paul or Julie, so long as it is what feels best or most comfortable for you and your character. Choosing a race would be the next best step, and there are nine basic playable races to choose from.</p>
