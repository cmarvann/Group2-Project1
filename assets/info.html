                    <h2>Welcome to the Character Creator!</h2>
                    <h3>Are you interested in Dungeoning some Dragons?</h3>
                    <p>For those that are new to this game, and even for experienced players who want somewhere to log their information, this application here is to help you get started on building a character. But before we go into how the form works, here is what you need to know for the basics of Dungeons and Dragons. We're going to give you the basic roles, settings, and how to set up your character through the playable races, classes, and skill proficiencies.</p>

                    <h3>Getting started</h3>
                    <p>As a basic description, Dungeons and Dragons utilizes a world of make believe usually taking place in a medieval and fantastical setting where magic, unusual creatures, and heroes exist. It is a roleplaying game where a group of people, large or small, gather and create characters to take part in this world that has been created. The adventure that the group goes on is usually called a campaign and can last however long until the story they're playing through is over. In playing these campaigns, two roles exist: <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> and <strong>Players</strong>. The <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> tends to be a single person that has set up the campaign, the world the players are in (including cities, inhabitants, and monsters), and narrates the story as the players go along. The <strong>Players</strong> interact with the world that is set in front of them, free to do just about anything with their characters. It is the role of the <strong>Players</strong> that this application focuses on completely, though the <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> can also utilize it in creating NPC's (non-playable characters).</p>
                    <h3>Character Creation</h3>                        
                    <p>Coming up with your own character from scratch can be a bit daunting at first, but there is no pressure towards coming up with something grand or fantastical. The best way to create a character is to go with what you know and like, as many first time players tend to create characters that are more like themselves in a fantasy world. The best place to start is with a name! It could be anything as fantastical Filavandrel or Cirilla to something as simple as Paul or Julie, so long as it is what feels best or most comfortable for you and your character. Choosing a race would be the next best step, and there are nine basic playable races to choose from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dragonborn</li>
                        <li>Dwarf</li>
                        <li>Elf</li>
                        <li>Gnome</li>
                        <li>Half-Elf</li>
                        <li>Half-Orc</li>
                        <li>Halfling/Hobbit</li>
                        <li>Human</li>
                        <li>Tiefling</li>
                    </ul>                        
                    <p>All of the races are humanoid but with different features, each race having different benefits depending on what you are looking for and the class you decide to pick for your character. If you are looking for something with inherent magical capabilities, Dragonborn or Tiefling races may be what you're looking for (as the Dragonborn is descended from dragons and Tieflings have demonic lineage). If you want something more subtle, maybe even practical with certain skills, Halflings are known for being sneaky and light on their feet. A race's particular attributes can certainly play into what you want your character to be capable of and how they form on their own from there. After you have a name and race for your character, you can move onto their class. Classes typically are a means of lifestyle for your character, a path they are either set upon or born into that they follow, and there are thirteen basic classes to choose from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Artificer</li>
                        <li>Barbarian</li>
                        <li>Bard</li>
                        <li>Cleric</li>
                        <li>Druid</li>
                        <li>Fighter</li>
                        <li>Monk</li>
                        <li>Paladin</li>
                        <li>Ranger</li>
                        <li>Rogue</li>
                        <li>Sorceror</li>
                        <li>Warlock</li>
                        <li>Wizard</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are subclasses that exist with each of these options, further deepening what you can do and possible lore you can add to your character, but it is always best to go simple at the beginning for those new to the game. With your character fleshed out with a name, race, and class, you can start looking into their skills and abilities.</p>

                    <h3>Skillsets</h3>                        
                    <p>When creating your character, there are proficiencies that already exist when you have chosen their race and class. As stated before, Tieflings and Dragonborn have a greater leaning towards magic than some of the other races, and if you chose a magic based class then there are specific abilities or skills that are already greater than others. Skillsets add to what you have already brought together and they don't always have to match with what you have already chosen for your character. You are free to choose whatever you think works best for your character, their backstory, or the abilities they already have. On the main page, if you click the buttons in the list of Skills, a description of what each skill pops up underneath the skill you have added to your sheet. Go through them and familiarize yourself!</p>

                    <h3>Off On Your Quest</h3>
                    <p>There is far more to Dungeons and Dragons than what is covered here, but for those that are new to the game, this is a very basic description. The more you get into the fantasy world, especially if you find a campaign to play in, there will be so much more information and intrigue to uncover. Whatever you create, however you decide to play, always make sure to have fun with what you're doing and the people you're roleplaying with! Below you can find a video that describes the typical character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons in a more in depth and amusing way.</p>
